<div class="title-bar"><p>focus can be used inside ui binding to set focus on particular control object in the dynamic-form.</p></div>

# Example

To set the `focus` on particular control object in your dynamic form, you can set the focus statically inside the `ui` property.

<div component="app-code" key="focus-complete-component"></div>
Next, we need to write html code.
<div component="app-code" key="focus-complete-html"></div>
<div component="app-example-runner" ref-component="app-focus-complete"></div>
