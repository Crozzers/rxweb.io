# Static Focus

To set the `focus` on particular formControl in your dynamic form, you can set the focus statically inside the `ui` property of the `serverData` in your component.

<div component="app-code" key="focus-static-component"></div>
Next, we need to write html code.
<div component="app-code" key="focus-static-html"></div>
<div component="app-example-runner" ref-component="app-focus-static"></div>
