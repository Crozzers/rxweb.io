If you are willing to put your efforts on the rxweb framework but confused where to start, no worries; This guide helps you out. This guide covers ways in which you can become a part of the ongoing development/documentation contribution of the rxweb framework.

# Help others
Help others is also the best way to starts in, If someone needs help on our <a href="https://gitter.im/rxweb-project" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gitter/rxweb-project</a> or <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=rxweb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stack Overflow</a> you can answer questions on the same. Even you find something already know or something you don’t know but interested in to dig into it a litter bit more to find the answer. Soon you will realize you know rxweb framework pretty well…

# Robust documentation
To make robust documentation is also one of the most valuable contributions in open source projects and also in the rxweb framework because improving the documentation is very valuable for those who want to use the rxweb framework.

All the documentation is available in <a href="https://github.com/rxweb/rxweb/tree/master/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs/</a>

# Fix something that helps others too
If you find a bug and that helps other users too, then try to find an existing issue. If it doesn’t exist yet, create one. Look into the code and do the changes. After that send a pull request and let give a chance to other contributors to use their brains to review the request.
