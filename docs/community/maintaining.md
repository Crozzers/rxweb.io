# Merging a pull request
Please, make sure:
<ul>
<li>Travis build is green.</li>
<li>At least one owner (other than you) approved the PR</li>
<li>All the <a href="/community/commit_guideline">commits follow the convention</a></li>
</ul>

# Becoming a maintainer
If you are interested in becoming one – be active in our framework by answering issues, reviewing PRs, discussing changes, submitting PRs for open bugs and help others on our gitter channel or stackoverflow. Once we see you are helping, we will give you push permissions. Being a maintainer is not an obligation. You can help when you have time and be less active when you don’t. 
These are all just recommendations, something we found to be helpful for us to be more efficient. Nothing is set in stone. If you have any suggestion to improve this workflow, please send a proposal to <a href="mailto:devs@rxweb.io">devs@rxweb.io</a>.
