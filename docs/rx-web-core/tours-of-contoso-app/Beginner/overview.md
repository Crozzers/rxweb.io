# Overview

As we all are very familiar with the Microsoft tutorial Sample Application of "Contoso University", we are going to demonstrate the same application examples through RxWebCore so that we'll be able to relate the same more efficiently.
Contoso University REST API
In this complete Beginner section of Tours of Contoso App, we'll walkthrough the guide to develop a sample web application on Contoso University which included the functionality of managing courses and their enrolled students in which you can perform the complete Web API operation including GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE with proper authentication and authorization of every user.
Here is the created REST API shown below:
