# Authentication

We have successfully created the Contoso University Application through rxwebcore and understood the project structure which was already created with the rxwebcore CLI. 

Now you may be wondering.. What about the authentication of user in the created project ?

When you are developing any enterprise application, effective user authentication is the key concern for any developer.
