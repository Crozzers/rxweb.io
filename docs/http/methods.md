# Get

You can use `get()` of `RxHttp` to request data and get the response in any of the format you want (for example: 'json') by setting the config in your component.

<div component="app-example-runner" ref-component="app-methods-get" title="Get" key="get"></div>

# Patch

The `patch` method of `RxHttp` is used for making partial changes to an existing resource by setting the config in your component.

<div component="app-example-runner" ref-component="app-methods-patch" title="Patch" key="patch"></div>

# Post

You can use `post()` of `RxHttp` to send new data to the server and get the response in any of the format you want (for example: 'json') by setting the config in your component.

<div component="app-example-runner" ref-component="app-methods-post" title="Post" key="post"></div>

# Put

You can use `put()` of `RxHttp` to update an existing data to the server and get the response in any of the format you want (for example: 'json') by setting the config in your component.

<div component="app-example-runner" ref-component="app-methods-put" title="Put" key="put"></div>

# Delete

You can use `delete()` of `RxHttp` to delete an existing data to the server and get the response in any of the format you want (for example: 'json') by setting the config in your component.
