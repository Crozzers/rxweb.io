# About Dirty Check
Most suitable cases to use dirty check in Edit form. This most common scenario where we need to check based upon provided value, if the value has been changed then the form become dirty.

Angular provides a field is called dirty in the FormControl. But this won't work if the user again changes the value as per the initialized value. But via isDirty function you can achieve the same.

# isModified 
`isModified` property is used to check whether any of the formControl value has been changed or not without checking the whole state, If any of the formControl value is changed it will change the state otherwise not. 

<data-scope scope="['decorator']">
First we need to create a user class and define properties in the model.
<div component="app-code" key="dirty-modified-model"></div> 
</data-scope>
<div component="app-code" key="dirty-modified-component"></div> 
Next, we need to write html code.
<div component="app-code" key="dirty-modified-html"></div> 
<div component="app-example-runner" ref-component="app-dirty-modified"></div>
