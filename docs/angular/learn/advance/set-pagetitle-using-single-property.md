In this application we need to set multilingual pagetitle using a single property without the need for any method or the code to change the title value just by using one single property provided by RxWeb.

Use the `pageTitle` property to bind the page title value automatically from the json files. 

Form the json value in the respective language files in order to resolve the data as per the language code as below:

<div component="app-code" key="set-pagetitle-using-single-property-complete-json"></div>
