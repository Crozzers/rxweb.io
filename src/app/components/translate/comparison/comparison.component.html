                    As a RxWeb Community Member, We respect all Open Source Community wonderful people on their
                    extraordinary work, We are the kid in front of them. They give us the inspiration to do our best for
                    providing the exemplary features of the library which makes enterprise application code must be
                    readable, maintainable, and faster. We don't prefer to compare their features with ours, Because
                    they have done a super job by spending a lot of time on the package for helping the community
                    developers. It's up to you to decide which is suitable for your project after analyzing all aspects
                    of your application requirement.

                <p class="comparison-content">
                    We have created this page to help you to decide whether this package is suitable for your project or
                    not. After releasing this package we have seen lots of queries where dev community is comparing this
                    package with others and would like to know the different features which are not available in others.
                    We are not saying that the features are provided by this package is not available in others. Every
                    package is designed with the different objective to solve the developer community problem. Our
                    objective is to provide elegant appraoch.

                <p class="comparison-content">
                    We got positive responses, exemplary suggestions to make our library more robust and give us the
                    confidence to spend more time on this package. But on the other side, we got some open fire negative
                    responses without knowing the features about the package on the good article posting sites. We are
                    not getting upset with the negative responses but we are
                    happy to know the problem rather than open fire statements.

                <p class="comparison-content">
                    Let's come to the point to share the features information.
                </p>
                <p class="comparison-content">
                    Before deep dive into the features would like to share the reason for developing this package.
                </p>
                <p class="comparison-content">
                    The core objective of developing this package is to code must be simple and readable, anyone can
                    understand easily without looking into the multiple files. Instead of reinventing the wheel try to
                    use as much as an available feature from the Angular and TypeScript.

                        Zero handwritten code for configuration, the 'rxweb' CLI automatically sets the configuration
                        while setup the translation.
                    </li>
                    <li class="rxweb_card_desc">
                        Zero configuration required on module level imports or service creation. Import the RxWebModule
                        in the root module and that works throughout the application.

                        We love design patterns/principles and with this package, you don't need to write any business
                        logic in the template as templates are not meant for that. Use Angular Interpolation double
                        curly bracket for traduction the text as per active language even though instance parameters required
                        in the text. The parameterized / Conditional text will be automatically resolved without passing
                        the additional object ðŸ˜Š. You may like it.

                        As we are a developer and we are busy developing overembellish functionalities to the
                        application. By considering this case we don't want you to write jumble of code of resolving the
                        multilingual content. Everything will be managed by using the @translate decorator even those
                        are Smart Component or Dumb (Page) Component.
                    </li>

                        Strongly Typed translation property. We won't say anything more about this. Have a look at the
                        video.

                    <li class="rxweb_card_desc">

                    <li class="rxweb_card_desc">
                        Our hunger won't be fulfilled by knowing the above features as there is a need where JSON file
                        won't work like Lookup data which is coming from the backend server and those will be changed
                        once
                        the application language is changed. Don't worry we have an optimum solution for this by passing
                        the
                        custom service class to the '@asyncTranslate` decorator. This gives full control to the
                        developer to
                        load the content according to the application of business logic. But wait!, How can we subscribe
                        to
                        the language change event? No, you don't haftoo worry about that, the custom service class
                        automatically initialized and method will be called once the application language will be
                        changed.

                    <li class="rxweb_card_desc">
                        On-demand parameter based scoped translation can be managed through TranslationService.

                    <li class="rxweb_card_desc">
                        Flexibility to load the translation content Before resolving the page component/shared component
                        as
                        well as you can load the content with Angular Pre Loading Strategy.

                        We don't prefer to cache the object into the browser memory or load the all language content
                        during load time of the page. Only those multilingual content will be loaded which is required. As we
                        said we don't prefer to cache the object into the browser memory because CDN is available then why we
                        have to cache the object. But still we have given a feature to cache the multilingual content into the
                        memory.

                        The most extensive feature which saves your time with this package is automatically generates
                        the keys in the JSON files based upon the written code in the template and Optimize the JSON file
                        after build the project. Optimization is not that a like minify the JSON data into one line but this
                        analyse all the template files and check that how many properties are defined in the JSON but not used
                        in the template those will be removed after firing the optimize command through rxweb cli.
